Rice Leaf Image Classification Project
This project aims to classify rice leaf images using a deep learning model to detect the state of the crop, 
thereby eliminating the need for constant present expertise and manual supervision of the crop.
The model was trained on the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification), 
which consists of over 10,000 color images in 10 distinct classes.
